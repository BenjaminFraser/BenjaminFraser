### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a Aerospace Engineering Manager (Avionics, Electronic and Electrical Systems), Data Science Practitioner and Technology Enthusiast. I have a specialist focus on Applied AI, Machine Learning and Data Science Technologies. My past experience in software, data science and programming dates back over a decade, with expertise developed on a range of professional and personal projects in that time.


### Some past projects:

- Development of an integrated crowd-monitoring and social distancing platform that exploits video surveillance data. Application of Deep Computer Vision, including Crowd-Pose Estimation, Object Detection, Tracking and Automated Homography. Research published through MFI2022 conference. Source code available: https://github.com/BenjaminFraser/Social-Distancing-Pose-Platform.

- Development of a Digital-Twin based Novelty Detection framework for Unmanned Aerial Systems, through the application of Deep Unsupervised Learning (Autoencoder-based) techniques. Published through IEEE as part of DASC2021 conference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9594321/.

- An Image Classification application built using Flask, Bootstrap and JS to allow for the uploading of a given image, which is classified accordingly. The preparation and formation of a deep convolutional network model was performed, making use of transfer-learning and fine-tuning of the Inception architecture. The application will classify images according to the specific transfer learning task carried out (the app was demonstrated with different dog breeds). Source code available at: https://github.com/BenjaminFraser/Dog-Breed-Classifier-App.

- A Python GUI application that uses Tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, scipy and other scientific computing libraries to provide classical and digital electronic and control engineering functions for graphical analysis. Developed whilst conducting a BSc in Electronics Systems Engineering, to support cohorts (and wider electronic engineering community via GitHub) in forming control engineering plots and visualisations. Available at: https://github.com/BenjaminFraser/Control_engineering_apps.
